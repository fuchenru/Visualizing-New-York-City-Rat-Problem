# Visualizing-New-York-City's-Rat-Problem

Project for SSC442

It is widely known that rats can pose significant risks to both human health and property. They are carriers of deadly viruses and have the potential to cause fires by gnawing on electrical wires. If you are a resident of New York, it's natural to be concerned about the presence of rats near your house. 

The New York City rat dataset is collected and maintained by the City of New York via their 311 portal. It provides information on the location, type, and date of rat sightings, as well as the actions taken to address the issue. The dataset is useful for us to analyze, including mapping rat populations, identifying hotspots, and studying the effectiveness of pest control efforts. 

By analyzing the New York City’s database of rat sightings, we hope to gain insights into the distribution of rats across different boroughs and types of buildings. This information can then be used to inform the development of effective pest control measures to address the rat infestation problem in the city.

The motivation for this project comes from the need to address the negative impact that rats can have on public health and the environment. By using data analytics techniques to analyze the New York City’s database of rat sightings, we hope to provide valuable insights into the distribution of rats in the city and to support the development of effective pest control measures. Through this project, we aim to make a meaningful contribution to the efforts to manage the rat population in New York City and to improve public health and well-being.

But the question remains, how can we determine where these rats are hiding?
